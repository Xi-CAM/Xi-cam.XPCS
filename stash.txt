Working on getting the Input kwargs properly set.
Adding minStep, min to the OneTime processor num_bufs Input.
minstep looks like it works
- user can change the value to odd, then step oddly (num_bufs has to be even)

min doesn't look like it is propogating correctly.
See how Input is setting its _limits and returning them (limits encapsulates min & max)

* Update the num_bufs description to show how to use it (must be even, if 0 then all frames are used...)

* Make the parameter widgets show the description (hover text?)

* Update how the default=0 value for num_bufs gets set to number of frames (+1 if odd)
